                      <p>Built in 1947, the 125 S was the very first car to wear the Ferrari name. Under its long hood lived a 1.5-liter V12 engine that sent 118 horsepower to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission, jaw-dropping statistics at the time. While it dropped out of its first race, it helped Ferrari secure its first victory during the 1947 edition of the Grand Prix of Rome.</p>

                      <p>The F40 was developed to celebrate the brand’s 40th anniversary. It made extensive use of composite materials, which was highly impressive at the time, and it offered a stripped-down interior that made occupants feel like they were traveling aboard a Le Mans prototype. The sharp, low-slung look has earned the F40 the distinction of being one of Ferrari’s most recognizable designs.</p>

                        <p>The Challenge Stradale offered enthusiasts genuine race car-like performance and features in an accessible, street-legal package. Starting with the 360 Modena, Ferrari engineers removed all equipment deemed superfluous in order to shed weight, lowered and stiffened the suspension, and fitted massive alloy wheels. Inside, the two passengers were treated to bucket seats with racing harnesses and Plexiglas windows.</p>

                      <p>You know a car is going to be a big deal when it’s named after the company’s founder. It’s the kind of homage a brand can only pull off once if it wants to retain its credibility. Luckily, the limited-edition Ferrari Enzo lived up to the hype.

                          In the early 2000s, Ferrari’s dominance of the hypercar market was under attack by Porsche, Lamborghini, and Mercedes-Benz. The Enzo had to beat the competition and make a bigger splash than the F50. </p>

                          <p>The LaFerrari was the latest in a long line of high-tech, face-meltingly fast hypercars built by Ferrari. Its name means “the Ferrari” in Italian, and it took the company forward by introducing new technology previously seen only on prototypes, concepts, or race cars.

                              Notably, it was the first street-legal hybrid produced by Ferrari.</p>

                          <p>At its launch, the FXX was the most technologically-advanced Ferrari by a long shot. It was a more extreme evolution of the Enzo developed with input from star Formula 1 pilots like Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello.

                              It came equipped with a 6.3-liter V12 engine that sent a whopping 800 hp to the rear wheels through an F1-derived automatic transmission. </p>

                  <p>The 488 GTB opened a new chapter in the history of Ferrari’s V8-powered, mid-engined machines. Born from the 458 Italia, the 488 received a twin-turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 engine that made 661 hp at a screaming 8,000 rpm and 561 pound-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm. It boasts 169.4 hp per liter of displacement, a record for a road-going Ferrari. Floor it and you’re at 60 mph in about three seconds.</p>

                      <p>You’re probably thinking, “Why the long face?” First, because the Colani Ferrari Testa d’Oro was designed in 1989, and this was precisely what the car of the future looked like at the time. Second, this wasn’t just another mundane supercar. It was envisioned as a Ferrari capable of setting speed records on Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats.

                          The car wasn’t actually designed by Ferrari, though the brand played a part in making it a reality.</p>

He took over Pininfarina after his father, Battista, died in 1966. He is responsible for numerous designs including the Ferrari F40, the Fiat Dino, and the Peugeot 504 coupe/convertible. He also helped draw the Ferrari 360.</p>
